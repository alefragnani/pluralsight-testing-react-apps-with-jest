# Pluralsight - Testing React Applications with Jest

Sample project used on the [Testing React Applications with Jest](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/testing-react-applications-jest) course from Pluralsight

## References

The course says to use the project from a previous course [Isomorphic React Course](https://github.com/danielstern/isomorphic-react.git). So, I imported that repo to create this one. The original readme is [here](./README-isomorphic-react.md)

## Tools & Environments

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

The project was developed using VS Code on a Remote Development Container. So, you don't need install anything to play with it.
